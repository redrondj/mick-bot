# Start coding your bot: Recast.AI + Slack

This Starter-Kit will help you start coding a bot connected to Slack with [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai/).

## Requirements

* Create an account on [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai/)
* Create an account on [Slack](https://slack.com/)

## Get your Recast.AI bot token

* Log in to your [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai/) account
* Create your Bot
* Create intents and fill them with some expressions
* Build your conversation flow on bot builder in the 'Build' tab
* In the tab menu, click on the the little screw
* Here is the `request access token` you will need to configure your bot!

## Get your Slack bot Token

* Go to https://YOUR_ORGANISATION.slack.com/services/new/bot (replace it with the name of your team)
* Create a new bot and follow the procedure
* That's it, you can now get the code located in the API Token field!

## Launch the bot

#### Complete the config.js file

* Clone this Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/RecastAI/bot-slack.git
```

* Fill the config.js with your tokens

```javascript
const config =
{
	recast: {
		token: 'RECAST TOKEN',
		language: 'en',
	},
	slack: {
		token: 'SLACK TOKEN',
	},
	port: 8080,
}
```

#### Run

* install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

* run your bot

```
npm run start
```

## Go further

Here is the heart of your bot. The following function is called every time your bot receives a message.
'res' is full of precious information:

* use **res.memory('notion')** to access a notion you just got in the input like a email address, a datetime etc...
* use **res.action** to get the current action according to your bot builder flow
* in **action**, you can find a done boolean to know if this action is complete according to the requirements (ex: booking need to signin, signin needs a login)
* use **res.reply()** to get the reply you've set for this action
* use **res.replies** to get an array containing the reply set for the action && the following one if the next action is complete
* use **res.nextActions** to get an array of all the following actions

For more information, please read the [SDK NodeJS documentation](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-NodeJS)

```javascript
rtm.on(slackEvent.MESSAGE, (message) => {
  const user = rtm.dataStore.getUserById(message.user)
  const dm = rtm.dataStore.getDMByName(user.name).id

	// CALL TO RECAST.AI: message.user contains a unique ID of your conversation in Slack
  // The conversationToken is what lets Recast.AI identify your conversation.
  // As message.user is what identifies your Slack conversation, you can use it as conversationToken.

  recastClient.textConverse(message.text, { conversationToken: message.user })
  .then((res) => {
    const replies = res.replies
    const action = res.action

    if (!replies.length) {
      rtm.sendMessage('I didn\'t understand... Sorry :(', dm)
      return
    }

    if (action && action.done) {
      // Use external services: use res.memory('notion') if you got a notion from this action
    }

    replies.forEach(reply => rtm.sendMessage(reply, dm))
  })
  .catch(() => {
    rtm.sendMessage("I'm getting tired, let's talk later", dm)
  })
})
```
